            Rules
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to keep things (somewhat) organized here on the Flash Dump, we have rules that apply to all Flash Submissions on the site. Please read the rules below before submitting a Flash SWF to be put on the site. Any Flash submissions on the site may be taken down from an authorized Admin for any reason that is deemed applicable. Though do note, we love creative internet content just as much as anyone else does, so we would only take down content that has violated the rules in someway.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Effort <br> All Flash content submitted onto the Flash Dump must have effort put into them. Do note that effort is not the same as quality. The quality of a Flash does not matter (as long as it is more than just scribles or lines on a screen). So long as it is clear that effort of some kind has went into your Flash, regardless of its quality in regards to how good you can draw or voice act, will stay up on the site. <br> *Usally Flash Movies will be defined as having effort into them if they are at least longer than 10 seconds, may have color, have sound, and either have a sort of plot line to follow or just a funny yet intelligible punchline. <br> *Usally Flash Games will be defined as having effort put into them if they are fully interactive, are able to be beaten (in the sense that the game is not impossible. This only does not apply to games that CLEARLY are not meant to have an ending like sandboxes.), and take longer than 30 seconds to comeplete while playing the game as intended. Flash games include a large variety of genres, sub genres, and general differences that sometimes it is hard to define if a Flash game has "effort" or not. Generally speaking, if you have to ask yourself if your Flash game has effort in it then it most likely doesn't.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Safety <br> please make sure to not include personal information in Flash content. Whether it be your own (you dumbass!) or someone else's with the intent of doxing, do NOT include personal information of any kind in any Flash you submit. It is okay to use your email and personal website in a Flash if you are using it either for contact or for credit.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. No Cyberbullying <br> Although the Flash Dump does allow explicit content, that is content that includes crude humor, gore, sexual refrences, profanity, and overall content that would be suitable for a teen or mature audience (except for total nudity!), we do not condone or encourage cyberbullying. It is fine to harmlessly make jokes about other people in your Flash, but please do not include direct threats or extreme negative talk about someone. This is somewhat of a grayarea, so just don't be too extreme or direct with anything and you should be fine. However, any content deemed worthy of deletion will be taken care of by our admins.
            </p>

                4. Have Fun <br> The point of the Flash Dump is to provide a space for close friends of mine to submit their Flash content to be enjoyed by other individuals around the globe. This content is obviously intented to be used for entertainment purposes, so treat it as such. This is not a serious rule in any way, but be sure to leave this site with a smile on your face when you are done.

                How to submit a Flash to the Flash Dump <br> Please contact me in person and ask for your Flash to be put on the Flash Dump. Just email me or provide me with a USB drive of the SWF file and I will place it on the site (So long as it follows the rules). This is pretty easy if you already know me, but will be much more difficult if you have no clue who I am. In order to keep quality content on this site I tend to only accept content from close friends of mine. If you are unfamiliar with me but would still like your Flash creation on the Flash Dump, then please just email me the SWF with the email linked below. I cannot guarantee that your SWF will be put on the Flash Dump however, as emailing it can lead to virsuses and other unwanted actions.
