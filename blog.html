        hey guys! It's been a while. During the weekend I was trying to get PHP on the site so that I could have users log in, create accounts, leave comments, rate flash content, ect. I ended up failing but I'm planning on coming back to the project. In the meantime I created "China: The Game", uploaded How to Babysit, and did a whole redesign of the Flash Dump. Go check it out! Expect to see more from me here in the next few days. I also plan on doing a huge update to Kill the Colin! See you guys later.
    <p>
        5/1/2024: later the same day! I recently uploaded Club a Seal HD, a remastered version of Club a Seal by Tom Fulp from Newgrounds. I also did a whole redesign of the Flash Dump. Now there is different colors!

        5/1/2024: Not much has changed. I uploaded "The (not so) Blues Brothers" Flash movie to the Flash Dump. I started working again on the website late at night yesterday and it is currently 1 AM. So technically I didn't skip a day in development, it just took me so long that it <u>turned into</u> the next day. oops. Well, from here I plan on getting new Flash content for the Flash Dummp from friends, adding more to the index page, and finishing some of my Flash movies. See you guys soon!

        4/29/2024: The next day! I've been pretty active recently so expect to see constant updates. I'm actually pretty excited to get everything working so progress from here should be pretty smooth. Today I added the Flash Dump page on this site. Flash Dump is like the Portal from Newgrounds, only it's for my close friends to use. Once I get some PHP working on this site I might open it up to the general public though, so that's exciting! You can access Flash Dump via the Flash animation titled so on the home page of my site. I have some game projects in mind and probably won't get to working on them for a while but I'll be sure to upload them here once I have. I also plan on having a HUGE redesign of the website since it is pretty messy.

    4/28/2024: hey guys! Today the website was created, woohoo! I plan on uploading all of my projects here. Currently I have some Flash games and movies I have made (some are still work in progress). Feel free to look around and see what there is currently. This website will keep being updated as the year goes on so keep checking here for updates. I'm currently working on a project titled "Maze of Fortune" with some friends of mine. Devleopments on the game and edventually the game itself will all be uploaded here. <br>Have fun guys!
