        4/29/2024: The next day! I've been pretty active recently so expect to see constant updates. I'm actually pretty excited to get everything working so progress from here should be pretty smooth. Today I added the Flash Dump page on this site. Flash Dump is like the Portal from Newgrounds, only it's for my close friends to use. Once I get some PHP working on this site I might open it up to the general public though, so that's exciting! You can access Flash Dump via the Flash animation titled so on the home page of my site. I have some game projects in mind and probably won't get to working on them for a while but I'll be sure to upload them here once I have. I also plan on having a HUGE redesign of the website since it is pretty messy.

Currently I have some Flash games and movies I have made (some are still work in progress). Feel free to look around and see what there is currently. This website will keep being updated as the year goes on so keep checking here for updates. I'm currently working on a project titled "Maze of Fortune" with some friends of mine. Devleopments on the game and edventually the game itself will all be uploaded here. <br>Have fun guys!
